bio = """
I'm a software engineer with 10 years of experience. I'm a generalist, though I have more experience with \
Python, Go, C++, and TypeScript.
At Deepset, as one of the main developer of Haystack, one of most used AI frameworks, I led major architectural \
decisions during its rewrite for the 2.0 major release. I was also the one responsible of the \
release and testing processes and the CI infrastructure, both for the main project and the monorepo \
containing all the Haystack integrations. While there I fully automated the release process and overhauled \
testing to cut the PRs lead time.
At Pitch I was part of the DevOps team and responsible for the release process. I changed it from top to bottom \
to enhance the user experience for developers and customers, including the notification UI shown to the end user. \
Together with the rest of the team I was also owner of the CI processes used by all the other teams and \
responsible of enhancing its developer experience.
At Arduino, I was a key developer of the Arduino CLI and contributed to Arduino IDE 2. There too I handled \
the build and release process and the CI infrastructure. I created the release and notarization \
process for the Arduino CLI for MacOS.
At Molecular Horizon I worked on several desktop application for medicinal chemists. \
While there I also took lead and ownership of a modernization project to move the build systems \
of the whole company, and a closely collaborating other company, from BitBucket and BuildBot to GitHub Actions.
I'm also an Open Source enthusiast and maintain and contribute to different projects. Occasionally I talk at conferences.
