# Resume

These are the sources for my resume, if you are interested you can find it on [here](https://resume.silvanocerza.com).

It's built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and deployed on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) as a static site.

# Building

To work on the resume:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

If you want to test the PDF generation you can run `pnpm build`, that will build the resume website and create a PDF file from it.
It's not necessary to commit the PDF file as it's generated on the fly each time the website is built for production.
